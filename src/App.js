                  <p>
                    I started my career in the nonprofit field, where I became familiar with the concept of "wearing many hats". 
                    My roles spanned multiple disciplines, from design work to public relations. 
                    This exposure also introduced me to website design and the creative problem-solving involved
                    in frontend development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Development challenges sparked my interest and led me to dive into the nuts and bolts of creating dynamic web apps. 
                    I decided to make the jump into development work full-time and kickstarted the transition with five months of 
                    intensive training through Flatiron School's software engineering program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I'm not at my computer, you'll likely find me painting, playing tennis, or browsing the shelves of the local library.
                  </p>
