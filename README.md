# Portfolio - Stacey McKnight

Welcome to my portfolio repo! I'm a nonprofit marketer turned full stack developer. To kickstart my career transition, I completed five months of 50+ hrs a week of training in full stack development through [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/). This site showcases some of the apps I developed through the program along with technical blog posts I've written.

## Technology

I built this portfolio with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and styled it with Sass modules to create a simple and responsive layout. The main graphics are SVGs I created in Adobe Illustrator.
