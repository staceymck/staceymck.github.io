# Portfolio - Stacey McKnight

Welcome to my portfolio repo! I'm a full stack developer with a background in nonprofit communications and graphic design. I'm currently building features, writing tests, and squashing bugs for a SaaS company in Chicago, primarily using Ruby and JavaScript.

To kickstart my career transition, I completed five months of 50+ hrs a week of training in full stack development through [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/). This site showcases some of the apps I developed through the program, technical blog posts I've written, and highlights from my current role.

## Technology

I built this portfolio with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and styled it with Sass modules to create a simple and responsive layout. The main graphics are SVGs I created in Illustrator, and I created the Lottie using After Effects. Click the dots in the top nav to swap out the colors!
